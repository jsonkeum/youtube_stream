# youtube_stream
App that allows users to login to a live stream with their google accounts

This app was created using create-react-app as a base. But it also makes use of a .env file
so it will not work even if you download the dependencies and run "npm start."

To see this project in action, visit https://youtube-streaming-tool.herokuapp.com

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack web application.
